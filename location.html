				Mombasa!My city my town.What is there not to love about the beautiful coastal city? From the pearly white sandy beaches to the crystal blue waters,not to mention the endless savoury coastal dishes that leave yout tastebuds wanting more.Nothing excites my soul than listening to the ocean waves and experiencing sundowners while sipping on mocktails!
